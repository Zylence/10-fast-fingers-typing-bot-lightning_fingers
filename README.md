# Lightning-Fingers-typing-Bot


# INTRODUCTION:

I am happy to announce my first project ever! Lightning_fingers in an easy-to-use cheat/bot that can type for you on the 10-fast-figers website. It was build around Python and popular Open-Source libraries such as Pytesseract and Selenium. I know it may not have been the smartest idea... but I had no other option than to code it in Python.

This Bot is meant to be LEGIT, so you can be playing in the leaderboards without getting banned. It has smart error feature and anti-anticheat build in. You can play multiplayer, competitions, everything! Everything it does is based around
probability so there are no repeating patterns!


# SETUP:

(A youtube video explaining the process may be linked soon...)

To unlock the full capabilities you will have to go to the following link and download and install the tesseract-ocr-w... setup exe that matches your Operating Systems Version(64 bit or 32 bit). https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

IMPORTANT: write down the path to the location where you install tesseract! You will need it. For most people it will look sth. like this:
"C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR" (without " and YOUR_NAME replaced with your user name)

After you have done this you need to add it to your "path variable". This can be done by pressing "win key" + "r" on your keyboard and then inputting
"sysdm.cpl" inside the dialogue box that pops up. You press enter an then choose the "Advanced" tab in the upcoming window and click "Environment Variables" at the bottom. Now in the "user variables" section you click "Path" once and choose "edit". You click on "New" and input the path which you safed somewhere earlier. That's it, you just have to confirm everything by pressing "OK".

PASSWORD FOR UNZIPPING: "Zylence"
Now you download the TWO zip files called lf.zip.001 and lf.zip.002 from this repo.
Safe them in the same location and unzip the first one using 7zip. The second one will automaticly be used aswell. This should yield you an exe file.

After running the exe you will be greeted by a black window. Don't be afraid, it just takes some time to start. Another window as well as a browser
will open soon. Once everything has started your firewall will ask you to allow the program. You have to allow it, otherwise it won't work.


# WALKTHROUGH:

You have made it congrats. Now it's time to enjoy the program ;)

As pointed out this program is meant to look legit. On the top right you can choose the "failure rate" at which smart typos will be made.
But I advise leaving it around 5%. 


Lets say you wanted to get some more or less legit looking stats first before starting to appear in the leaderboards.
You can do so using "Stat Creator". 
-> at the top input the wpm you wish to achieve -> input the number of games you want the system to play under "Stat Creator" -> click "GO!" below "Stat Creator" -> enjoy!
It will play and create you a record, so it doesn't become to obvious that you are cheating. And here is the cool thing: You don't have to watch it! You NEVER 
have to watch it! After starting any mode, you can just minimize the window it will still work!! So you do not have to waste any time.

IMPORTANT:
-NEVER USE STAT CREATOR WITH LESS THAN 100 WPM (IF YOU WANT YOUR INITIAL STATISTICS TO END UP AT 180, PICK 180)
-ONLY USE STAT CREATOR ONCE!

NOTE:
-The more you make it play the more legit it look. Unless of course you let it play to much... i Advise between 20 - 50 games to start with. But even 100 should be just fine.


After you have done that. The Anticheat will want you to evaluate your result. No Problem!
-> input your desired wpm up top -> head over to the evaluation process -> click "Start" on the website -> click "GO!" below "Anti-Anticheat"

NOTE: this may not work immediately. It's a little luck based if your system can read the picture. Just retry..


At this point you have a legit looking statistic and are most likely appearing in the leaderboards. But There is still plenty you can do:

"Normal" is meant for all the modes and challenges that are accessible directly from the main page of 10 fast fingers.
-> input wpm at the top -> input failure rate -> hit "GO!" underneath "Normal"

"Multiplayer" is a special mode for competitions where you go head to head with others. Procedure stays the same.


MODES:

"Rage Mode", "Dynamic Mode" and "Standard Mode" can be paired with any of the game modes! Simply select it before starting.

"Rage Mode" inputs words with no delays and no errors. It enables speed up to 3000 wpm depending on your systems capabilities. (But you can't control your speed! Only use this if you want to get banned!)

"Dynamic Mode" Is the most accurate mode for achieving your desired results. (It also works better on low-end PCs)

"Standard Mode" Is the most legit but less accurate of the three.


The "STOP" Button will close all applications.


# HINT:

When playing on a low-end PC or laptop you can try inputting higher wpm numbers such as 300, 400 ... this will shorten the timing and may enable you to get higher speeds. 
But first try if you really need it!



In case this explanation was not clear enough, just experiment with the program a little. You pretty much can't break anything unless you really try.. ^^ 
HF using it and securing a position at the top ! :)
